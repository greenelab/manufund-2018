## Proposal {.page_break_before}

Manubot is a system for writing scholarly manuscripts on GitHub.
Manubot aims to **transform publishing** to be transparent & reproducible, immediate & permissionless, versioned & automated, collaborative & open, linked & provenanced, decentralized & hackable, interactive & annotated, and free of charge.
Wooh!

Manubot applies **tactics from open source** software to manuscript writing.
Manuscripts are written in markdown, using git for version control and GitHub for collaboration and review.
Continuous integration automatically rebuilds and deploys the manuscript when it changes [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3780; @doi:10.1038/550143a].
Manubot provides many state-of-the-art features.
For example, users cite standard identifiers, while bibliographic details are automatically retrieved.

Currently, the Manubot consists of two repositories: [`greenelab/manubot-rootstock`](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock) (a blank manuscript with the required files) and [`greenelab/manubot`](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot) (a backend Python package).
As of December 2017, [10](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock/graphs/contributors) individuals have contributed to the **Manubot codebase**, which has [33](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock/stargazers) ⭐s on GitHub.
For more information on the Manubot, see [these slides](http://slides.com/dhimmel/manubot#/) as well as the in-progress [Meta Review](https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/).

We initially created the Manubot to enable the **Deep Review**, a review paper on deep learning that we collaboratively drafted [on GitHub](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review).
Over 30 authors contributed to the Deep Review [@doi:10.1101/142760], using [issues](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to discuss source material and [pull requests](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr) to propose manuscript changes.
The community appreciated the breadth of perspectives on a quickly-developing topic and the Deep Review was the most-viewed _bioRxiv_ preprint from April–June 2017 [@doi:10.1038/d41586-017-08493-x].
We've also used the Manubot to write our [Sci-Hub Coverage Study](https://greenelab.github.io/scihub-manuscript/) and to reproduce the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://dhimmel.github.io/bitcoin-whitepaper/) [@tag:steemit-post].

We are seeking support to fund Manubot development in 2018.
Some **specific aims** that we're excited about are:

1. JATS is the predominant archival format for scholarly manuscripts that is optimized for machine-readability and interoperability.
We want the Manubot to **export to JATS** and to incorporate an existing **JATS viewer**, such as [Lens](https://lens.elifesciences.org/about/), into Manubot webpages.

2. Currently all changes to a manuscript's source are tracked using git.
However, Manubot does not automatically generate **diffs for rendered outputs**.
By creating rendered diffs we can show how a manuscript changed from the reader's perspective and make creating "tracked changes" documents for journal resubmission easy.

3. **End-to-end reproducibility** is when the provenance of every manuscript result can be traced to its source.
Manubot allows users to pass template variables, so results can be embedded directly from the analysis that created them.
We'd like to experiment more with the templating system and make it as user-friendly as possible.

4. We have several ideas for making **Manubot's citation metadata** system even more powerful and versatile.
We're confident that citing (only) by standard identifiers is the way of the future and Manubot can serve as a reference for other applications deciding to implement citation-by-ID.

5. Currently Manubot requires considerable technical expertise [to setup](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock/blob/f165f609f33b11fdf71a0db6435d4dd159f23973/SETUP.md) and some technical expertise [to use](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock/blob/f165f609f33b11fdf71a0db6435d4dd159f23973/USAGE.md).
Therefore, the target userbase is researchers or publishers who are already using tools like git and continuous integration for other tasks.
Another continuing aim is therefore to support **outreach and user adoption**, as well as identifying which potential users will benefit most from the platform.

Our **long-term vision** is an improved system of scholarly communication, brought about by tools such as Manubot.
Manubot forms the foundation for the traceability of all aspects of a scholarly manuscript.
Imagine the following.
Click an author to highlight only the text they wrote.
Or highlight all results and figures that descend from source code contributions by the selected author.
Or highlight all results that depend on a selected upstream experiment or database.
Did an input to the manuscript change?
Rebuild the manuscript with the updated input and see the resulting changes...
regardless of whether you're the original authors or a curious third-party!

_Now is the time to bring the innovation and ethos of open source software development to the scholarly manuscript.
Join us in powering the next generation of scholarly manuscript._
